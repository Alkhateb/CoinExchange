# Coin Exchange
Compares the Greedy and Dynamic Programming implementations of a coin exchange algorithm based on the number of errors in 1000 trials.

The Dynamic Programming implementation should always return the fewest number of coins in order to make change for a given amount. The Greedy algorithm does not if we use the coin set [1,4,5,9]. This program counts the number of errors in the Greedy implementation by change amounts from 1-1000.
